"""
An example of how to use the the Alfred Dependency Bundler with Python.

To use the Bundler, include `bundle.py` in your workflow. Get it here:

https://github.com/shawnrice/alfred-bundler/blob/aries/wrappers/bundler.py

This workflow uses the Alfred-Workflow library, which helps with a lot
of the mundane aspects of building a workflow (generating XML, debugging).

If you're thinking of writing an Alfred workflow in Python you should
*strongly* consider using this, or another, workflow library. They take
care of a lot of the boilerplate for you.

Alfred-Workflow can be found here:

https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow

Brief overview of the Bundler
=============================

The Bundler allows you to use a number of common workflow utilities to do
add functionality to your workflow, such as showing notifications or dialog
boxes for user input, using common OS X utilities (such as terminal-notifier
or cocoaDialog) without every author needing to include the utilities in
their workflows.

There is also an icon API that allows you access to ~1000 icons in the
colour of your choice.

Finally, the Python version of the Bundler allows you to transparently
install any Python libraries your workflow needs (using Pip and its
requirements.txt) without the need to include large libraries with your
workflow.

Overview of this Demo
=====================

Please see the docstrings and comments in the `Demo` class for a
detailed explanation of how this demo works.

As well as demonstrating how to use `bundler.py`, this workflow also
shows one way you can structure your workflow code.

Full Bundler details
====================

More information on the default utilities and the JSON file format can be
found on the Bundler homepage:

http://shawnrice.github.io/alfred-bundler/

The complete documentation for the Python version is in the source code
of the `bundler.py` wrapper.

The currently available icons can be viewed here:

# Imports
#=====================================================================

# Importing `unicode_literals` means that instead of using u"string" to
# represent a Unicode string and "string" to represent a byte string in
# source code, "string" is a Unicode string and b"string" is a byte
# string. In most cases, this will make coding easier, but you still
# have to be sure to properly encode/decode Unicode and bytestrings, so
# your workflow doesn't die in flames when given non-ASCII text.
from __future__ import print_function, unicode_literals

# bundler wrapper
import bundler

# Initialise the bundler
# This method call will ensure that the bundler is installed and
# will install any Python dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
# This may take several seconds the first time it's called from this
# workflow. Subsequent calls will be very fast.
#
# ONLY call this method if you have a `requirements.txt` file.
# The Bundler will also be installed if you call any other `bundler.py`
# functions.
#
# Info on the format of `requirements.txt` can be found here:
# https://pip.pypa.io/en/1.1/requirements.html
#
# Basically, just use the "pip name" of your library (i.e. the name
# you'd call `pip` with *not* what you `import`, though they're often
# the same) plus `==` and the version you require, e.g.:
#
# requests==2.3.0
# pytz==2014.4
#
# `bundler.py` will notice if your `requirements.txt` has changed and
# will update your dependencies. If it hasn't changed, it won't do anything

# Global Logger. It's set to a valid Logger from Python's standard
# `logging` library at the bottom of the script
log = None

# Similarly, we'll populate this with `Workflow`'s method of the same
# name. It's *very* important to ensure all input is decoded to Unicode
# and all output is encoded to UTF-8 text, or your workflow may die in
# flames when given non-ASCII text. *Always* test your workflow with
# non-ASCII text to ensure it works okay.
decode = None


# Utilities
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

# We'll also get any dependencies we need here to ensure they're
# installed on the first run. We don't want our workflow to randomly
# fail in the future because the computer/GitHub is offline the first
# time a particular utility is called. Again, this first call may take
# several seconds, as the requested utility may need to be installed
# (the Bundler will inform the user if this is the case) but subsequent
# calls will be *extremely* fast (the Python wrapper caches the results,
# so the actual Bundler is not called unless the requested utility has
# disappeared, i.e. been uninstalled)

# terminal-nofitier is a utility to display notifications
terminal_notifier = bundler.utility('terminal-notifier')

# Pashua is a utility to display dialogs to get input from the user
pashua = bundler.utility('Pashua')

# cocoaDialog is another utility for showing dialogs. It's not as
# configurable as Pashua, but also does simple error/message dialogs
# and progressbars.
# Either Pashua or cocoaDialog would be sufficient for the needs of
# this workflow, but as it's a demo, why not show how to use both?
cocoa_dialog = bundler.utility('cocoaDialog')

# Icons
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Normally, we'd also want to grab any icons we're going to use in the
# workflow in addition to the utilities (to ensure they're installed on
# first run), but as this workflow displays a random set of icons, this
# would most probably slow the workflow down on every single run until all
# 300+ icons are in the cache. Even then, if you change the colour (one of
# the functions of this demo), the whole caching business would start
# again.
#
# So just one sample icon this time.
